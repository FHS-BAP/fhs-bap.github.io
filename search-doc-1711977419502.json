Since 1971, the Boston University Aram V. Chobanian &amp; Edward Avedisian School of Medicine (BUMC) has served as NHLBI contractor and academic partner for the study. In 2020, the BUMC received an infrastructure grant from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to establish the FHS Brain Aging Program (FHS-BAP).  Since its inception, the FHS-BAP Data Core has played a crucial role in strengthening the data infrastructure necessary for studying brain aging, cognitive decline, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), and all causes of dementia. Our comprehensive strategy for managing and sharing FHS clinical and longitudinal exposome data for AD-related research encompasses a wide range of information. This includes legacy data such as demographic characteristics and common risk factors collected from FHS core exams, laboratory biomarkers covering proteomics and genomics data, as well as neuropsychological (NP) assessments, Brain MRI/PET data, and Brain tissue data. Meanwhile, we also make great efforts to incorporate new clinical data, including medication records, physical activity assessments, surgical history, lifestyle, diet, as well as novel digital markers related to health data. Upholding the principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) in data management, we ensure the integrity and accessibility of this valuable data. Through close collaboration withFHS-BAP internal cores, FHS contract staff, FHS study research collaborators, and external teams worldwide, we facilitate the seamless collection, auditing, quality control, processing, and sharing of curated tidy datasets to ensure data accuracy, reliability and research-analysis readiness.
