Since 1971, the Boston University Aram V. Chobanian &amp; Edward Avedisian School of Medicine (BUMC) has served as NHLBI contractor and academic partner for the study. In 2020, the BUMC received an infrastructure grant from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to establish the FHS Brain Aging Program (FHS-BAP).  Since its inception, the FHS-BAP Data Core has played a crucial role in strengthening the data infrastructure necessary for studying brain aging, cognitive decline, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), and all causes of dementia.  tip Our strategy for managing and sharing FHS data for AD research covers a wide range of information, including legacy data like demographics and risk factors, lab biomarkers, NP assessments, and Brain MRI/PET data. We also incorporate new clinical data and digital markers. Upholding FAIR principles, we ensure data integrity and accessibility. Through collaboration with FHS-BAP internal cores, contract staff, and external teams, we facilitate the collection, auditing, and sharing of curated datasets for analysis.
