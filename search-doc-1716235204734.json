Credibility: Including data documentation in the introduction section enhances the credibility of the FHS-BAP Data. Researchers are more likely to trust and rely on information that is accompanied by thorough documentation, as it indicates that the data is well-researched and accurately represented. Accuracy: Data documentation helps researchers understand the limitations and potential biases associated with the data. It provides insights into any assumptions made during data collection and analysis, helping researchers interpret the information accurately and avoid misinterpretations. Accessibility: By including these data documentations, researchers have easy access to relevant information about the FHS-BAP data. This accessibility is essential for users who want to delve deeper into the data or verify its accuracy independently. Promote Collaboration: Data documentation facilitates collaboration among different stakeholders, such as data analysts, researchers, and developers. By documenting the data in a clear and structured manner, it becomes easier for researchers to communicate, share insights, and collaborate on data-related projects.
